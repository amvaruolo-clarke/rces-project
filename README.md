Scientific Question: What is the stationarity of tropical pacific teleconnections over South America?

http://kage.ldeo.columbia.edu:81/SOURCES/.LDEO/.ClimateGroup/.PROJECTS/.CCM3/

For this project I will follow a previous analysis done by an alumni in my lab to look at the temporal stationarity of teleconnections between the tropical Pacific Ocean and South America ([Coats et al. 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/grl.50938); where their analysis focused on North America). I will use the Global Ocean-Global Atmosphere (GOGA) simulation of the Community Climate Model version 3 Atmospheric Global Circulation Model; these simulations are housed in the IRI Data Library and a 16-member ensemble is also available. I will define a correlation between tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and 200 mb geopotential heights over particular seasons across different chunks of time (50 0r 100 years) over the model simulation to understand the temporal variability of the teleconnections.
